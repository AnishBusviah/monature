  "Description (English)":"The Mauritius kestrel is a bird of prey from the family Falconidae endemic to the forests of Mauritius, where it is restricted to the southwestern plateau's forests, cliffs, and ravines. It is the most distinct of the Indian Ocean kestrels. It colonized its island home to evolve into a distinct species probably during the Gelasian (Late Pliocene).It is the most distant living species among the western Indian Ocean kestrels (Groombridge et al. 2002, qv Réunion kestrel).By 1974 the Mauritius kestrel was close to extinction, with only four known birds including one breeding female. After a number of conservation efforts, by 2019 there was a population of about 400 birds. This conservation achievement is regarded as one of the most successful and best documented bird restoration projects in the world. It was proclaimed the national bird of Mauritius in March 2022 to mark the 30th anniversary of the Republic of Mauritius.",

  "Description (English)":"\nThe echo parakeet is a parrot species endemic to the Mascarene Islands of Mauritius and formerly Réunion. It is the only surviving native parrot in the region, with other species having gone extinct due to human activity. The echo parakeet has two recognized subspecies: the extinct Réunion parakeet and the living echo parakeet. DNA analysis confirmed their subspecies status. These parakeets are closely related to the extinct Newton's parakeet of Rodrigues and the rose-ringed parakeet of Asia and Africa. Measuring 34-42 cm in length and weighing 167-193 g, the echo parakeet is predominantly green, with distinct collar patterns on the neck, differing between males and females. They inhabit forests with native vegetation, mainly found in Mauritius' Black River Gorges National Park. Nesting in tree cavities, they lay two to four white eggs. Feeding on native fruits and leaves, their population declined throughout the 20th century due to hunting and habitat destruction, but intensive captive breeding efforts saved them from extinction. With a population of 750 birds in 2019, they are now classified as vulnerable, previously being critically endangered.",

It is classified by BirdLife International as being vulnerable. It is also on the United States' Endangered Species List with an endangered status.This bird is 12 to 13 cm long. It is yellow with an orange face and brown back, wings, and tail.The bird can be found in the canopy at heights of at least 5 metres, and sometimes travels in flocks. It may be associated with the Norfolk Island pine (Araucaria cunninghamii ) and some introduced species of plants. More birds are found in areas with more dense stands of taller trees and higher diversity of tree species. It feeds on insects, spiders, seeds, nectar, and fruit.Once abundant on the island, the bird was nearly driven to extinction with only 5 or 6 pairs remaining by 1968. Due to conservation efforts its numbers rose to between 911 and 1200 individuals by the year 1999.The main threat to the species is the destruction of its forest habitat. The forest was cleared for subsistence farming and livestock. The bird also competes with its introduced relative, the Madagascar red fody (Foudia madagascariensis ). Cyclones and drought reduce the food supply.Conservation efforts have included reforestation, the main cause of the increase in fody numbers. Fences keep out livestock.",
